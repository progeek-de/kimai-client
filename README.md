# Kimai Client (work-in-progress üë∑üîßÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚õè)

Kimai-Client is a multiplatform (Windows, OSX, Linux) desktop client written in Kotlin for Kimai Time Tracker.

Kimai Client offers seamless integration with the Kimai Time Tracker Server, allowing users to manage multiple workspaces simultaneously. This integration facilitates efficient time tracking across multiple projects and clients. All time tracking data is securely stored on the designated Kimai server, which supports both on-premises and SaaS cloud options, ensuring data privacy and easy accessibility.

## Connection

To get started with Kimai Client, make sure you have a working Kimai setup, which can be your own server or a Kimai Cloud account. Generate an API password and login with your credentials.

## Dark mode

For design enthusiasts, Kimai Client's Dark Mode is a stylish option to consider. You can easily switch between the traditional bright interface and the elegant dark theme. This feature not only enhances visual comfort, but also adds a personal touch to your time tracking experience.

## Compose Multiplatform
As mentioned above, this app's UI is completely written in [Compose
Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/).

## Compose for Desktop client
This client is available in compose-desktop module and can be run using ./gradlew :kimai-desktop:run. Note that you need to use appropriate version of JVM when running (works for example with Java 17)
